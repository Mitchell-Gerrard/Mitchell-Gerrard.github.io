        <p>I am currently exploring how nonlinear optical effects, combined with distributed computational techniques, can be used to determine and control the internal pressure of Anti-Resonant Hollow-Core Fibres (ARHCF). By modelling how light interacts with gases inside these fibres, my work aims to enable precise, scalable pressure characterisation and support the development of next-generation hollow-core fibre technologies.</p>
        <h3 class="major">What are Anti-Resonant Hollow-Core Fibres?</h3>
        <p>Anti-Resonant Hollow-Core Fibres (ARHCFs) are a class of optical fibre designed to guide light through an air-filled central core rather than through solid glass, as in conventional fibres. They use a carefully engineered cladding structure—often formed from thin-walled glass capillaries arranged in configurations such as the seven-tube tubular fibre shown below—to confine light by anti-resonant reflection rather than total internal reflection. This design enables exceptionally low nonlinearity, reduced latency, and low scattering losses, particularly at wavelengths where standard fibres struggle. Their hollow structure also makes them ideal for gas–light interaction studies, high-power pulse delivery, and precision sensing, as the core can be filled with gases or other media to tailor the fibre’s optical properties.</p>

        <h3 class="major"> Why would using nonlinear optics be a good idea?</h3>
        <p>
        Using nonlinear optics is advantageous because it allows light itself to act as a highly sensitive probe of the conditions inside the fibre. Nonlinear effects such as self-phase modulation, cross-phase modulation (XPM), and four-wave mixing (FWM) respond strongly to changes in gas pressure and density within the hollow core. These processes alter the spectrum, phase, and energy distribution of the light in ways that can be precisely measured. By analysing how these nonlinear signatures evolve along the fibre, we can determine pressure without intrusive sensors and with far greater sensitivity than purely linear methods. In hollow-core fibres—where the light interacts directly with the gas—nonlinear optics provides a fast, robust, and powerful approach to distributed pressure measurement and characterisation.</p>
        <h3 class='major'> What work has been published?</h3>
        <p>Currently the work has been presented at multiple confrences including Photon 24 and CLEO europe 2025 with CLEO publishing the abstract corisponding to this work.</p>
